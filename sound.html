            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sound is a fascinating branch of science that explores the vibrations and waves that propagate through a medium, usually air. These vibrations create the auditory sensation we perceive as sound.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Sound Travels</h2>
            <p>Sound travels in the form of waves, which consist of compressions and rarefactions. These waves need a medium, such as air, water, or solids, to propagate. The speed of sound varies depending on the medium.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Properties of Sound</h2>
            <p>Sound has several characteristics, including frequency, amplitude, and wavelength. Frequency determines pitch, amplitude affects volume, and wavelength is the distance between consecutive compressions or rarefactions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Reflection,Refration and Diffration</h2>
            <p>Similar to light waves, sound waves can undergo reflection, refraction, and diffraction. These phenomena are responsible for effects such as echoes, the bending of sound around obstacles, and the spreading of sound waves as they pass through openings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Propagation</h2>
            <p>Sound requires a medium for propagation. In a vacuum where there is no medium, sound cannot travel. The speed of sound varies depending on the properties of the medium. For example, sound travels faster in solids than in liquids and faster in liquids than in gases.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Amplitude and Volume</h2>
            <p>Amplitude refers to the magnitude of the oscillations in a sound wave. It corresponds to the loudness or volume of the sound. Greater amplitude leads to a louder sound, while smaller amplitude results in a quieter sound.</p>
